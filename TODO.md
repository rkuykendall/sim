# TODO

## UI/UX
- [x] Select first building by default
- [x] Quit button on home screen
- [x] Full screen mode by default
- [ ] Kid-safe quit button (hold-to-quit or similar)
- [ ] A way to delete saves which is safe for kids. How can we make kid-safe features but keep them touch-screen accessible?

## Save System
- [x] Auto save

## Camera
- [ ] Bumpers near the edge of the map for the camera
- [ ] Have the camera stop dead center of the viewable map edge

## Bugs
- [ ] The music cuts out after a while and the simulation is totally crawling
